# mgWebClient-HandsOn-Course
## Lesson 1-9 - Creating SPA Project


Notes:

Lesson 1:

The page notes differ from the video.
The instruction Open the mgSPA folder and add another folder with the name "Resources" should read
Open the projects\mgSPA\SPA folder and add another folder with the name "Resources"


Lesson 3:

server-config.json screenshot and code don't match
(no big deal)

package.json is not in the src folder (page incorrectly lists src\package.json)


Lesson 8:

The "Replace the Login" code section has inconsistent naming for the login.component.html content - magic field names should be prefixed with V_ such as V_vUser - while that looks a little strtange, it's V_ in the typescript together with the usual vName format for virtuals in Magic.


Lesson 9:

Setparam expr in text is wrong, contains invalid expr ref ???

Start Menu json is wrong, should be /Login not Login/Y

Login Program Task Properties Behavior Confirm Update should be set No

Json for menu expression after login in the screen shot is wrong: contains erroneous String parseJS eval fragment

Login program checker error message:
"Performance multiple accesses to server please check if they can be combined" is never explained

Custom form property expression in StartProgram for User needs to be trim(A) so that span display logic works properly and orphan Hello: doesn't display
