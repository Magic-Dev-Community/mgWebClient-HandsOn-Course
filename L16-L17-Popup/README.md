## Lesson 16-17 - Popup


Notes:

Lesson 16:

There's no mention of creating the pCity parameter until it's used, but it's obvious to any Magic developer.

It seems like the select popup needs an angular SelectionModel added but I didn't go the extra mile.

I did make a mistake and created the SelectCity program under the Admin folder. No worries.
