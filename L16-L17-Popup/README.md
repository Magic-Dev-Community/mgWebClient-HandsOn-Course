## Lesson 16-17 - Popup


Notes:

Lesson 16:

There's no mention of creating the pCity parameter until it's used, but it's obvious to any Magic developer.

I did make a mistake and created the SelectCity program under the Admin folder. No worries.

I have an unresolved issue that once a city is selected in SelectCity it is not highlighted (as cited in course note "The selected city is highlighted with a blue outline"). Likely my mistake I'll go back through.
